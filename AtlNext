- Zealots can roam 5 tiles from army to attack lonely, forbid that!
- Either all melee attack or either all retreat, no single unit attacking



- Always avoid when close to unwalkable and melee near


- Forbid separating Goons. They always have to be 0.5 distance from each other. And also in group. In radius of 1 there has to be at least 2 goons!
- When running and further than 1, force them to fire at min cooldown.
- Make GOons way braver, avoid only when cooldown really high and overall prioritize shooting. Also use formation more often, don't engage, stand in line and contain.


- Check if StopRetreat actually stops all units or just one



- Build cannons at NATURAL CHOKE, not in main. There was no main, but after 6 min of game, do it. Why did it happen?


- Dragoons should not run far from other goons in early game, cause lings arte faster and cheaper in any numbers and it takes 2 goons to kill them

Dont go into range of shot of sunkens
Look into HoldDragoon, only if enemy facing and moving, test on minimaps
