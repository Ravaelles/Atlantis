### Protoss ############################################################################################################

----- Dragoons go out from main, 0 dist from Zealot and dont attack, AdvanceStandard

---- Goons also go to a killed LastTarget and dont do anything. Check if unit is visible

.!!!--- Units often freeze after attack during Defend. Unfreezer

!!!.--- No WithdrawWrongSide, Dragoon holding choke!

----- Pylon grid and Gateway. Make Pylon always on the left


-- Zealots try to attack Goons in another region (close to base). Introduce one Shuttle?

.-- broken base locations


### Terran #############################################################################################################

.------ 1500 min / 1500 gas for bio only - probably no upgrades and not enough upgrades

---- Double robotics & observatory
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-------------------- No OBSERVER movement

--------------------------------- Terribly broken Targeting

.---- Wraiths sacrificing v Goons, only run near 30hp, Should go 2 repair, obviously die at spot

------- High ground for tank as (any high ground | in radius 7 | having ground path) + force eager siege during defend

- Still no Turrets against Scouts
- No bunker no turret at natural
- Distinct SecureBunker logic from SecureTurret

.------ RunFrom1.0 goes like 30, psionic broken! :O
