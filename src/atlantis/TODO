.- tanks sieging vs Wraith with TooFarFromFocus

- does it make sense to focus on wraith if tanks will go there?





- Tanks dont make one line against enemy tanks
- Nearly no air superiority
- Build turrets against enemy Wraiths


- Dont focus on tanks at all vs Protoss and Zerg, Bio + Wraiths





- 2 Wraiths running from one Wraith, didnt ever attack



- Fix repairer not repairing, Vulture moving to it and waiting for ever "To repairer"
