???----- Early push, 45%, no defend


------- High ground for tank as (any high ground | in radius 7 | having ground path) + force eager siege during defend
--- Broken natural - 3 different logics

- Still no Turrets against Scouts
- No bunker no turret at natural
- Distinct SecureBunker logic from SecureTurret
