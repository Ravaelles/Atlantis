.- tanks sieging vs Wraith with TooFarFromFocus

- does it make sense to focus on wraith if tanks will go there?





- Tanks dont make one line against enemy tanks
- Nearly no air superiority
- Build turrets against enemy Wraiths


- Dont focus on tanks at all vs Protoss and Zerg, Bio + Wraiths







+++ Produce early vultures o marines if look stack; check free supply

- Need TerranProductionIfLotOfResources
- 2 Wraiths running from one Wraith, didnt ever attack
- Not scanning Wraiths at all, even with 200; same with Ghosts
