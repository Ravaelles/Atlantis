- Refinery trying to be built as regular building, probably because two orders at the same supply

.- tanks sieging vs Wraith with TooFarFromFocus

.- no tanks nor other units produced even having 5k minerals and 2k gas and factories with addons

- ReinforceNewBaseWithCombatBuilding: futureBase == null

- does it make sense to focus on wraith if tanks will go there?
