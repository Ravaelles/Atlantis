### BUGS ###

- Still no Turrets against Scouts
- No bunker no turret at natural
.- still marines engaging far from tanks to attack cannons etc

?- Targeting still prefers some buildings over Scouts and Observers or even marines just standing

- Distinct SecureBunker logic from SecureTurret

.- Impossibly bad performance when 200 units, even without cannons, but especially with cannons.
.- Do a tweak to not run most of managers when enemy not known and supply > 120

.- Make Vessel fly over the squad scout

?- marines not loadng into bunkers even if near and only 2 inside

?--- Very broken expansions (natural is detected ok, pribably secure bunker problem

------ RunFrom1.0 goes like 30, psionic broken! :O

-----------------------------------------------
- Bunker securing the main
-----------------------------------------------

..----- AvoidCombatBuilding logic is broken, units suicide. It's slow, so simply leave one logic (hold)


### FEATURES ###

..++++ Build turrets against enemy Wraiths/Scouts

.+++ Road to enemy base

++ Performance improvement for situation when there's Combat Building nearby. 3x slower when one cannon nearby.

.+ Consider high ground for tanks

+ Wall-in

###############

(.)?+ Focus on the logic of expanding to natural - move army first, then build CC + bunker + turret

+ Wiki with recommended features (P - Paints extensive debug info)
