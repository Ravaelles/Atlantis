### Protoss ############################################################################################################

!.- Dragoons unable to get OnTheWrongSide
Dragoons not choosing AroundFocus targets


--- NextBaseHasNoPosition
---- Scouts getting killed easily; dont use more than 2, then use Dragoon?

- Dragoon not attacking most Wounded Dragoon, out of 3, he chose 2nd least wounded

--- No army cohesion, no line

!.------ ChokeBlocker - 1 of 2 zealots not attacking enemy zealot, has mision move
.---- Still Dragoon (and Probe) production even with only 230 minerals and SHOULD EXPAND
.--- Dragoons getting stuck near unwalkable and other Gateway


.?--- Pylon - force GRID. Currently impassable circle
- Base is still not built because there is an order, but NextBase is dunno, null? Check NextBasePosition
.(!)!- Make Goons a pioneer, not zealots

+ Create more minimaps



### Terran #############################################################################################################

.------ 1500 min / 1500 gas for bio only - probably no upgrades and not enough upgrades

---- Double robotics & observatory
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-------------------- No OBSERVER movement

--------------------------------- Terribly broken Targeting

.---- Wraiths sacrificing v Goons, only run near 30hp, Should go 2 repair, obviously die at spot

------- High ground for tank as (any high ground | in radius 7 | having ground path) + force eager siege during defend

- Still no Turrets against Scouts
- No bunker no turret at natural
- Distinct SecureBunker logic from SecureTurret

.------ RunFrom1.0 goes like 30, psionic broken! :O
