### BUGS ###

- Still no Turrets against Scouts
- No bunker no turret at natural
.- still marines engaging far from tanks to attack cannons etc

- Distinct SecureBunker logic from SecureTurret

- Impossibly bad performance when 200 units, even without cannons, but especially with cannons.
- Do a tweak to not run most of managers when enemy not known and supply > 120

- Make Vessel fly over the squad scout

?- marines not loadng into bunkers even if near and only 2 inside

.--- Not direcrlt producing Marines even if 3k minerals and 90/150
.--- Not building more than 3-4 barracks even if 3k minerals

.--- Units leaving tanks too far and thus being killed, tanks waiting and not shooting

.- Tank being a leader waits in back, while other units advance

.- Tanks should unsiege if DTs near

?- Cohesion wait is not working, two army groups

.- Tanks having destroyed marines, still are attacking e.g 3. If late game, always retreat to squad center if squad < 10

.- Starport not having place for addon (Refiner)

-- Absoolutely awful performance with Scouts & Carriers

?--- Very broken expansions (natural is detected ok, pribably secure bunker problem

------ RunFrom1.0 goes like 30, psionic broken! :O

-----------------------------------------------
- Bunker securing the main
-----------------------------------------------

..----- AvoidCombatBuilding logic is broken, units suicide. It's slow, so simply leave one logic (hold)
